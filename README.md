# CloudTrail Terraform Module

Configure CloudTrail to send events to an S3 bucket and CloudWatch log group

## Usage

The simplest use case, with nearly all defaults.

    provider "aws" {
      region = "eu-west-1"
    }

    module "cloudtrail" {
      source    = "deanwilson/cloudtrail"
      namespace = "testy"
    }

This creates an S3 bucket and CloudWatch log group, with `testy` as a prefix to
help reduce naming conflicts, and adds all the required policies to permit
CloudTrail events to be sent to them.
